Description: Scalable template engine for Perl5.
 Xslate is a template engine, tuned for persistent applications, safe as 
 an HTML generator, and with rich features.  
 .
 There are a lot of template engines in CPAN, for example Template-Toolkit, 
 Text::MicroTemplate, HTML::Template, and so on, but all of them have some 
 weak points: a full-featured template engine may be slow, while a fast 
 template engine may be too simple to use. This is why Xslate is developed, 
 which is the best template engine for web applications. 
 .
 The concept of Xslate is strongly influenced by Text::MicroTemplate and 
 Template-Toolkit 2, but the central philosophy of Xslate is different from 
 them. That is, the philosophy is sandboxing that the template logic should 
 not have no access outside the template beyond your permission.
